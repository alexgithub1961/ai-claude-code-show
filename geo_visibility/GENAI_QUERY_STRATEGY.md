## Search Intent Classification

### High Intent (Ready to Hire)
- "consultants for X"
- "companies that build Y"
- "who can help with Z"
- "firms that do X"

**Expected Behavior**: May trigger vendor mentions or recommendations.

### Medium Intent (Research Phase)
- "how to implement X"
- "best practices for Y"
- "what is Z"
- "X vs Y"

**Expected Behavior**: Educational content, may mention tools/platforms but not services.

### Low Intent (Learning)
- "what is X"
- "introduction to Y"
- "benefits of Z"

**Expected Behavior**: Pure educational content, no vendor mentions.

---

## Hypothesis Testing

### Primary Hypothesis
**H1**: GenAI/LLM queries are newer and Google's AI Overview may not have established patterns to avoid vendor mentions.

**Test**: Do these queries trigger more AI Overview responses than generic "software development" queries?

### Secondary Hypothesis
**H2**: High-intent queries ("consultants for", "companies that build") may trigger vendor mentions.

**Test**: Compare mention rates across intent levels.

### Tertiary Hypothesis
**H3**: Problem-based queries may mention solutions/vendors as part of the answer.

**Test**: Do problem-solving queries get different treatment?

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case Scenario
- AI Overview appears for 20-30% of queries
- Some vendor mentions appear in high-intent queries
- First Line Software appears in 1-5 queries

### Realistic Scenario
- AI Overview appears for 10-20% of queries
- Mostly educational content, minimal vendor mentions
- First Line Software appears in 0-2 queries

### Worst Case Scenario
- Same as previous assessment: AI Overview rarely appears
- No vendor mentions
- Zero visibility for all companies

## Strategic Value

### If Results Are Positive
1. **Content Strategy**: Create content targeting high-performing query types
2. **SEO Focus**: Optimize for queries that trigger AI Overview
3. **Thought Leadership**: Become cited source for GenAI topics
4. **Case Studies**: Build portfolio pieces that could be referenced

### If Results Are Negative
1. **Confirms Pattern**: GEO visibility issue is systematic
2. **Resource Allocation**: Don't over-invest in GEO optimization
3. **Alternative Channels**: Focus on LinkedIn, content marketing, community
4. **Long-term Monitoring**: Track quarterly for changes

## Query Design Principles

### 1. Natural Language
Queries phrased as real customers would ask them:
- ✓ "who can help integrate OpenAI API"
- ✗ "OpenAI API integration services provider"

### 2. Specificity
Mix of specific and general:
- Specific: "RAG architecture consulting services"
- General: "generative AI consulting for enterprises"

### 3. Action-Oriented
Focus on verbs that imply seeking help:
- "implement", "build", "integrate", "optimize", "deploy"

### 4. Current Technology
Use latest terminology:
- RAG, LLM, GenAI, GPT-4, semantic search, vector search

### 5. Business Context
Enterprise/professional context:
- "enterprise", "production", "compliance", "scale"
